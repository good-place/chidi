# chidi

Simple web library and generators.

## Motivation

At the begining it is be only backend story. HTML can be static, generated
by the Mendoza, or dynamic by the simple [Temple] templates. All data are stored
in [Mansion], and accesed through reception.

The frontend will be custom, but TwinSpark.js or htmx will be preffered way if
communication.

## Installation

You need to have [Janet] language and all dependencies installed. Then you can
install `chidi` with `jpm`:

`[sudo] jpm install chidi`

## Usage

### App Generation

When you have  `chidi` installed you can generate new application with it:

`chd generate --app-name test-chidi`

Then you need to `cd test-chidi` and run server:
- / root, which serves site directory (presumably generated by [Mendoza])
- not-found for everything else

`chd server`

## TODO

- [ ] just the server
- [ ] come with better story
