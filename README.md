# chidi

This is not lib yet, more of a prototype of how project generated with chidi
will look.

## Motivation

To create and maintain framework for real-time applicaitons and REST APIs akin
to [Feathers] plus [JAMStack] in [Janet] programming language.  Better name will
be WAMStack, as I would like to use wasm for FE.

At the begining it will be only backend story. Service are generated by the
macros. All html will be static, generated also by [Mendoza].

## Usage

You need to have [Janet] language and all dependencies installed. Then you have
to setup db with `./setup-chidi`, then finaly just run `./chd`. Only 
'application/json' content-type is accepted by the server. You can test it with
curl: 

`curl -v -H "Accept: application/json" http://127.0.0.1:8130/people`

## Tests

To run tests, first run test server with `./test-chidi` then with `jpm test`.

## TODO

- [ ] remove test app and tests
- [ ] make standalone lib
- [x] add service macros
- [x] separate framework from application code
- [x] minimal working example
  - [x] circlet server
  - [x] json only services
  - [x] sqlite storage
  - [x] all usable http verbs
