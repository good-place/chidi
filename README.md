## Motivation

To create and maintain framework for real-time applicaitons and REST APIs akin
to [Feathers] with the help of [Janet] programming language. 

At the begining it will be only backend story. There will be no generators
(cause macros).

# Usage

You need to have [Janet] language and all dependencies installed. Then you can
just run `./server`. For now only home with basic message and not found page,
are implemented. Also only 'application/json' content-type is accepted by the
server.

## TODO
- [ ] minimal working example
  - [x] circlet server
  - [ ] json only services
  - [ ] sqlite storage
